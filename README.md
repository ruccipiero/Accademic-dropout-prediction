# Accademic-dropout-prediction
On a dataset created from a higher education institution (acquired from several disjoint databases) related to students enrolled in different undergraduate degrees, from the papers and the dataset available in Zenodo:

1. V. Realinho, J. Machado, L. Baptista, M. V. Martins. (2021). “Predict students' dropout and
academic success” (1.0) [Data set]. Zenodo. DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.5777340

2. M. V. Martins, D. Tolledo, J. Machado, L. M. T. Baptista, V. Realinho. (2021) "Early
prediction of student’s performance in higher education: a case study" Trends and
Applications in Information Systems and Technologies, vol.1, in Advances in Intelligent
Systems and Computing series. Springer. DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-72657-7_16

The project was part of a competition where I scored 4# on 19 participants.

The ojective of the competition was predicting dropout or academical success of the students.

In the repository you can find 2 files:

1. file called "dropout-prediction-playground_bestscore.ipynb" and that's the one that gave me the best result

2. a file called "dropout-prediction-playground.ipynb" and that's a more tidy version with baesian tuning that didn't get me the same results (in terms of accuracy)
